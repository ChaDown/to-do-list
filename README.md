# to-do-list

My To-Do List is my most advanced app yet. It's a slick and fully functional app. 

You can create to-do items and create projects, and group your items into whatever project you choose. 
For each item there are options to mark as completed, change priority, edit, add to project and delete. 

The local storage API is used and all changes are automatically saved. 

The project is designed using ES6 modules. There is an index.js file and several other modules imported. It is bundled together for distribution using Webpack.
